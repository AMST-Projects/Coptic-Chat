# Coptic Chat
Coptic Chat (name subject to change). An easy way to connect with Copts anonymously. Used to speak to an Abouna, General Servant, or Coptic Therapist.

## Considerations
- We need a way of authenticating people who will accept anonymous chats.
- For safety reasons, chats will most likely need to be logged. They will be encrypted and identifiable. No single person will be able to decrypt chats on their own.
- Since chats are identifiable, they are not truly anonymous. We will need to create a Privacy Policy stating what data is collected used to identify users. We'll also need to state under which circumstances chats will be decrypted and identified.
